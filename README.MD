 ## Findings

The highest paid player in the rankings is Simona Halep with a total career prize money over $40m. There is a $26m difference between the 1st and 10th ranking.
The highest paid player this year to date is Elena Rybakina with a total of $3.2m. There is a $2.4m difference between the 1st and 10th ranking.

There are 4 players that have had No.1 career high ranking with Iga Swiatek being the current No.1.

Majority of players currently on tour are in their 20s (73%). There is only a small percentage in their teens (3%) while the remaining 24% of players are in their 30s. The median age of players is 26 with the youngest player being 17 and the oldest player being 37.

There is a weak correlation between rankings and win:loss ratio. Therefore, it can be inferred that a higher ranking isn't exclusively dependent on wins and losses. The type of tournament won and, consequently, points earned are more likely to have an effect on rankings.

Right-handed players dominate the rankings (90%) whereas left-handed players are in the minority with only 10%.

USA boasts the most top-100 players with 14 in the rankings. They are followed by Russia with 10 players and the Czech Republic with 8. Hungary comes in 10th with 3 players in the top 100.
